
<h2>Supervisor mode</h2>
<h3>Purpose of supervisor</h3>
<p>
In supervisor mode, you'll take full control of the pinball: Displays, lamps, and solenoids. 
</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>
To open the supervisor dialog box, select "Tools->Supervisor..." from the menu bar. Opening the dialog box won't change
the current mode, Hence, at the first opening the selected mode is the normal mode. To switch to supervisor mode and get control on all outputs
you'll have to click the red button labelled "Super". The led on the top right of the window then turns red, indicating you have 
the control. At this time, lamps and coils are all turned off for security. The GUI shows in yellow all the outputs that will be activated when
you click "Apply" on the corresponding bank or "Apply all" for applying your set-up on all banks. 
</p>
<p>
In parallel, display control is immediately taken over. For example, if your setup for display A is something like "01234...",
you'll see display of player 2 displaying 012340. 
</p>


<p>
What we call Display A0..15 and Display B0..15, is actually the internal shift register of the 10788 PPS4 GKPD chip.
There is a simple correspondance between the digits position and the corresponding internal value.
