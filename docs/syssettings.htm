<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This dialog box allows you to alter the persistant data of the board. It is accessible from the menu Tools>System settings. 
	You must be connected through wifi (green connection led) before accessing data.</p>

<h3>Using the System settings dialog box</h3>
<p><img src=":/help/docs/img/system_settings.png"></p>
<p>
   Data is transferred instantly to the non volatile memory of the board, as soon as a checkbox
   is ticked/unticked, or a new startup mode is selected. 
   Nevertheless, the data is not actually applied until a board reset is done 
   (either by the physical reset switch or with the soft reset button of the WiFlip app) 
</p>

<h2>Group box: Startup mode</h2>
<p>
	There are 3 radio buttons:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#nm">Normal</a>: This is the exact way the original pinball starts.
		</li>
		<li><a href="#mm">Miniprinter</a>: This mode is an emulation of the original miniprinteer equipment from Recel.		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#fm">Factory</a>: Applies a safe, factory set of data. 
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h3 id="nm">Normal</h3>
<p>The board will start with data from the last session (game settings, user data, etc...).
			This is the exact way the original pinball starts.</p>
<h3 id="mm">Miniprinter</h3>
<p>This mode is an emulation of the original miniprinteer equipment from Recel.
			While the board is 100% compatible with the original miniprinter, it is highly dubious that
			you have one available at hand. This is why this mode was created.
			The board first load the miniprinter data, which is included in its dataset. Miniprinter 
			data can be read/modified, saved/loaded from the memory inspection interface.
			Initially there is a "factory settings miniprinter" which is meant to be compatible with anay game.
			Miniprinter data will overwrite all the values that were previously stored by the pinball 
			during the last session (handicaps, freeplays, model number... all data).
			This very same miniprinter data will be used at every startup of the machine until you select another mode.
</p>
<p>This mode is not very useful, since you may prefer the <a href="gamsettings.htm">game settings</a> dialog box, which allows you to do
   almost the same things, in a more user-friendly evironment.
</p>


<h3 id="fm">Factory</h3>
<p>In this mode, factory settings are applied. To be used on first power on of the mother board to set up its presets or when things went wrong, 
	or when you are lost.
    During next reset, this radio button will automatically switch to <strong>Normal</strong>.
    You will stay in factory mode, until you change it for Normal, or Miniprinter.</p>
<p>	When factory radio button is selected, option checkboxes are dimmed. You cannot change them.
</p>
<p>What is the factory settings state? When factory settings are applied, the options 
	are all unticked, meaning that they are in the following state:</p>
<p>Options:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#cro">Coin rejector is active</a></li>
		<li><a href="#sco">coil self test done</a>, potentially preventing the pinball to complete its test phase.</li>
		<li><a href="#smo">Standalone switch matrix</a> is off. The MPU won't read switch states if not connected to a good mux board.</li>
		<li><a href="#cco">Unprotect coil channels</a>. The complementary coil protection is activated.</li>
	</ul>

	
</p>
<p>Miniprinter data: This set of data is restored in such a state that it is compatible with any selected game.</p>			
<p>RAM data: This set of data is restored in such a state that it is compatible with any selected game.</p>			
<p>Production number: This field is restored to the real ID of the MPU (actually, it is a subset of 
	the daughter card's serial</p>
<p>Model number: This is the current game installed (Given by Recel in the old times, 4-digit). Then, since factory settings 
   remove any currently installed game, this number is reset to the actual factory installed game. <code>CACE</code> means "Crazy race".
</p>
<p>Previous installed game and BIOS version are masked, after a factory reset. This means that the game applied will be the default one.
   The model number in the game settings indicates what are the factory default games and BIOS. <code>CACE</code> means "Crazy race" is the active
   game.
</p>
<h2> Group box: Option settings</h2>
<p>Options are actually applied after a reset.</p>
<p>Options are:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#cro">Coin rejector is active</a></li>
		<li><a href="#sco">Skip coils self test</a></li>
		<li><a href="#smo">Standalone switch matrix</a></li>
		<li><a href="#cco">Unprotect coil channels</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h3 id="cro">Coin rejector off</h3>
<p>The coin rejector coil is located behind the coin door. It is rarely useful for home usage of a pinball.
   Besides, it makes annoying noise sometimes, and it consumes power for nothing. You can turn this coil off with this option.
</p>
<h3 id="sco">Skip coils self test</h3>
<p>At boot up, Recel pinballs perform a selftest. In several cases, the machine halts if a test did not pass. This 
	is especially the case with coil test against short circuit or if play signal can't be detected. You may want to let the pinball 
	continue its tests and not stop there, although it is generally not recommended. 
	There is a specific case where this option, is useful: When the board is not connected to the pin (bench tests)
</p>
<h3 id="smo">Standalone switch matrix</h3>
<p>The state of switches (from the switch matrix) is read by the MPU board through the mux board. If the mux board is
   not connected to the MPU board (bench test, or standalone mode of the MPU board), then all swithches are detected in the closed state.
   Then, it is impossible to use the emulated switch matrix of the WiFlip app. This option was designed for preventing this situation,
   by reversing the state of switches by software.
</p>
<p>Of course, this option must not be used in normal operation, since in such a case all switches will be seen closed by the MPU.</p>
<p><p><span style="color: crimson; font-size: 24pt;">&#x26A0;</span>When you can't start a game for example, this is a typical case. 
Always check that this option is set in accordance with your environment (standalone or embedded).</p>
<h3 id="cco">Unprotect coil channels</h3>
<p>A special protection circuitry is provided for coil channels (C#/6..C#/F)</p>
<p>When the protection is activated, no coil may be kept activated for more than 3 seconds. If such a situation appears, 
	the coil is turned off for 3 seconds, then returns in its state (from pinball software), for no more than 3secs 
	if this state was on, etc...</p>
<p>This protection is not provided on the original Recel pins. Instead, there is a rearmable fuse of 3A located in the cabinet 
   on the power supply board. This protection is useful, but may be insufficient in certain cases to protect power transistors or coils themselves.
   We have had the case sometimes, in particular with the ball rejector coil.
</p>
<p>We thought it might be even more useful since we provided a way to emulate a permanent switch closing (triple clicking a given switch).
   This feature is provided to allows you to emulate hitting a target that is only reset by a bank reset. But if you triple click the Ball Home
   switch, then the pinball will trigger the ball home rejector permanently, and this is not good.
</p>
<p>Conversely, you may find games were a coil needs to be permanently powered. We never met with such a situation, but you never know.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you want to have an exact replica of the original board, then you will tick this option</p>
<p>It is reecommended to leave this option unticked, to get the benefits of this complementary protection</p>

<h2>Reset tool button</h2>
<p>Click this button to trigger a pinball reset. All operations will stop immediatly, and a reboot occurs.</p>
<p>Click this button to see the applied changes. It is equivalent to click this button, press the physical on board button, or 
   turn the power off, then on.
