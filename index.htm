<h1>Quick Introduction</h1>
<p>Wiflip allows you to connect with any type of PPS4 core clone for pinball machines</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Wifi Connection</h1>
<h2>First connection</h2>
<p>First thing to do is to let Wiflip know about your network in order to connect to it</p>
<p>Turn on the pinball. Then, from a PC, look for a wifi network with a name like WiFlip_XYZT and connect to it.
The wifi password for this network is 
<font face="Courier New">shootagain</font>.</p>
<p>Once the connection is established, open your browser (such like Firefox) and in the url field, enter the following address: 
<font face="Courier New">http://192.168.4.22</font>.
</p>
<p>You will reach a page asking for your home gateway credentials, namely name and password</p>
<p>Enter these data, validate, and wait for a success message.</p>
<p>If it does not work, this might be that you entered a wrong password or that the network is temporarily unreachable, or off range.</p>
<p>Repeat the operation until it works (success message).</p>
<p>The success page will display the local IP that is given to the WiFlip device. Please, note the indicated value. 
Something like <font face="Courier New">192.168.1.18</font>.</p>
<p>Once it is done, don't forget to reconnect your PC to your usual home gateway. You won't need to connect to the WiFlip_XYZT any more, unless your DHCP server reattached another IP address to the WiFlip device.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the DHCP server changes the device address it had given previously (after a gateway reboot, for example, or after that many new devices are declared on your local network, or simply after that a timeout has elapsed.</p>
<p>You usually realise that the address has changed, after the connection is suddenly impossible to make. In such a situation, you will need
to go to the WiFlip_XYZT again and check the indicated IP given by the DHCP server.</p>
