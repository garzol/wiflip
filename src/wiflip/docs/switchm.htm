<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>This is the emulation window for switches</p>
<p><img src=":/help/docs/img/switchwindow.png"></p>
<p>Every black ball represents a switch of the switch matrix. Clicking any of these ball is 
   equivalent to hitting the corresponding switch of the pin for 300ms or so.  </p>
<p>There is a way to maintain a switch closed. Simply triple-click the ball and it will stay closed 
   (appearing in red color).</p> 
<p><span style="color: crimson; font-size: 24pt;">&#x26A0;</span>
   Be careful with this feature, because in some cases, it can lead the pinball to activate 
   a coil permanently. This might burn it, or the controlling transistor. For example, 3-clicking on Ball home switch
   will trigger the ball home coil rejector permanently until the switch is seen open.
</p>
<h3>Calques</h3>
<p>Select the calque you wish to get the corresponding role of switches, in relationship with the corresponding
   game.
</p>
<p>Hovering the mouse on balls triggers the corresponding tooltip.</p>
