<h2>Game settings</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This dialog box allows you to alter the persistant data of a game. It is accessible from the menu Tools>Game settings. 
	You must be connected through wifi (green connection led) before accessing data.</p>

<h3>Using the Game settings dialog box</h3>
<p><img src=":/help/docs/img/game_settings.png"></p>

<p>Data field shows a green background when its content is valid. It shows a red background when data is invalid. 
	It is possible to get red fields at dialog opening, since data might be uninitialized or have been corrupted for some reason.
	On the orginal MPU, the most frequent cause of data corruption is related to NVRAM battery being flat, disconnected, or changed.
	This won't happen on the MPU clone. Our clones use "F-RAM" technology, which does not need any battery back-up. Apart from a first boot, 
	the data should never become incorrect. 
</p>
<p>Conversely, it is impossible to save a set of data if at least one field is red. 
   You must change the parameter for a correct value before you can save the whole set of configuration.</p>

<p>Most of the parameters can be tuned with the buttons B1,B2 that are located behind the pinball door, but not all.</p>
<p>From the switch matrix dockwindow, you can also use the soft B1 and B2 buttons to tune the game parameters, 
	exactly as you would do with the real B1, B2 buttons.</p>
<p>Typically, it often occurs that an handicap field appears in red, because it is not initialized and contains hex digits, above 9. 
	Such contents must be corrected and changed for a decimal number, if you want the machine to count correctly during a game.</p>
<p>This is exactly the same situation as on an original MPU, where data must be correctly initialized (with a miniprinter).</p>
<p>There is an alternate solution to reset handicap scores : Just play a game (or fake it with the switch matrix dockwindow, that's easier :-)) and reach at least 2Millions. 
	The Recel software will automaticaly reset the handicap of the given tableau to 1M</p>
<h3>Memorizing your changes</h3>
<p>You can alter as many fields as you want. </p>
